            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p> hello and welcome to my very first website! my name is Nthabseng Sedibe, and i'm just starting my journey into the world of web 
                development. i've always been curious about how website work, and now i'm finally taking the time to learn and build something of my own.
                this websites is my little corner of the internet where i can share a bit about myself, my interests, and the things i'm learning as i go. i enjoy exploring new technologies,
                solving problems, and creating things that people can use and enjoy. through this websites, i hope to not only practice what i'm learning but also connect with others who are on a similar path. 
            thank you for visiting, and i hope you enjoy looking around as much as i enjoyed building this.</p>

                    <p>I found that learning to code can be really fun as it is a way  to  do what I want and write beautiful websites by just typing some words and commands</p>
